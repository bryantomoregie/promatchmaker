		question: "What is Matchlight?",
		answer:
			"A matchmaking experience where a real person finds your match, with AI doing the heavy lifting behind the scenes.",
	},
	{
		question: "Who is my matchmaker?",
		answer:
			"Someone who already knows you - a friend, family member, or anyone in your life who wants to help. You choose who advocates for you.",
	},
	{
		question: "Why do both people get interviewed?",
		answer:
			"Because your matchmaker can share things a profile never could: your humor, your values, what you're really like to be around. Two perspectives give us the real picture.",
	},
	{
		question: "What kind of questions do you ask?",
		answer:
			"Diagnostic questions that reveal the real story: Why do you think they're single? What would their ex say? What are they like when no one's watching?",
	},
	{
		question: "How is this different from apps?",
		answer:
			"Apps hand you a list of strangers and ask you to swipe. Matchlight gives you a matchmaker who knows both people and only introduces you when there's a real reason to.",
	},
	{
		question: "What does the AI do?",
		answer:
			"It reads matchmaker notes, spots compatibility patterns, and surfaces potential matches. It never reaches out to anyone or makes introductions on its own.",
	},
	{
		question: "Who is Matchlight for?",
		answer:
			"Singles who want a more personal way to find their person, and matchmakers who love connecting people and want better tools to do it.",
	},
	{
		question: "Is my information safe?",
		answer:
			"All data is encrypted with row-level security. Nothing is shared with third parties. You control your data completely.",
	},
	{
		question: "What's the connection to The Introduction?",
		answer:
			"Matchlight was built by The Introduction to power our own matchmaking. Now we're opening it up to more matchmakers and more singles.",
	},
	{
		question: "When does it launch?",
		answer: "Soon. Join the waitlist and we'll let you know.",
